### Instruction:
You are trying to answer a question based on information provided by a data scientist.


Given the stats:
<question>Does receiving a promotion in the last two years affect turnover rates?</question>

Given the question answer stats:
<stats>
    {'columns': [{'column_name': 'received_promotion', 'column_stats': {'mean': 0.5, 'median': 0.5, 'std': 0.7071067811865476, 'min': 0.0, 'max': 1.0, 'quantile_25': 0.25, 'quantile_50': 0.5, 'quantile_75': 0.75}}, {'column_name': 'left_company', 'column_stats': {'mean': 0.47901642193066296, 'median': 0.47901642193066296, 'std': 0.011919255847614071, 'min': 0.47058823529411764, 'max': 0.4874446085672083, 'quantile_25': 0.4748023286123903, 'quantile_50': 0.47901642193066296, 'quantile_75': 0.4832305152489356}}], 'extra_stats': None}
</stats>

Given the dataset sample:
<data_sample>
    [{'employee_id': 'E10000', 'name': 'Mia Smith', 'age': 29.0, 'department': 'HR', 'job_level': 'VP'}, {'employee_id': 'E10001', 'name': 'Stefanie Castro', 'age': 47.0, 'department': 'Admin', 'job_level': 'Manager'}, {'employee_id': 'E10002', 'name': 'Angela Dunlap', 'age': 28.0, 'department': 'HR', 'job_level': 'VP'}, {'employee_id': 'E10003', 'name': 'Keith Ruiz', 'age': 52.0, 'department': 'Finance', 'job_level': 'Senior'}, {'employee_id': 'E10004', 'name': 'Larry Perry', 'age': 62.0, 'department': 'Operations', 'job_level': 'Intern'}]
</data_sample>

Given the code used to generate the stats:
<code_used>
    ```python
from agentpoirot.tools import func_tools
from agentpoirot.utils import save_stats_fig
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/Users/issam.laradji/projects/agent-poirot/web/static/users/issam/human_resources/dataset.csv')

# Stage Name: Data Manipulation
# Create a new column to indicate if an employee received a promotion in the last two years
df['received_promotion'] = df['promotion_last_2_years'] == 1.0

# Calculate turnover rates for employees who received a promotion and those who did not
df_turnover = df.groupby('received_promotion')['left_company'].mean().reset_index()

# Stage Name: Plotting
# Plot the turnover rates based on promotion status
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.barplot(data=df_turnover, x='received_promotion', y='left_company', palette='viridis')
plt.title('Turnover Rates Based on Promotion Status')
plt.xlabel('Received Promotion in Last 2 Years')
plt.ylabel('Turnover Rate')
plt.xticks(ticks=[0, 1], labels=['No', 'Yes'])
plt.ylim(0, 1)

# Save the plot and its stats
save_stats_fig(df_turnover, fig=plt.gcf())
```
</code_used>

Instructions:
* Make sure the insights are consistent and justified with the plot image, but make sure you say the most surprising insights
* Based on the stats, data_sample, and the plot image and other information provided above, write an answer to the question enclosed with <question></question> tags.
* The answer should be a single sentence, but it should not be too high level and should include the key details from justification.
* Write your answer in HTML-like tags using all the tags in the example response below.
* Refer to the following example response for the format of the answer and justification.
* make sure to use the descriptions provided in the Example response below
* Each of the tags should be in a new line and should only contain one sentence
* Make sure all generated text is concise, easy to read and understand so it should be in laymans terms
* Make sure you are very quantitative in your responses
* For the severity, whether it is clear, low, medium, or high, it depends on how far the insight is from a dangerous threshold
* something surprising would be like an interesting correlation or a trend that is unexpected
* see how factors relate to each other and whether things are consistent or out of the ordinary 
* The output for the <insight> tag should explain an interesting, surprising discovery of a trend or insight from the data_sample and the stats
* The output for the <insight> tag should be very specific and should use as many numbers as possible
* The output for the <header> should summarize the biggest takeaway from the insight
* Do not say significant when things are not statistically significant or if there is a low correlation or low p-value
* The insight should be based on the code_used and the data_sample and the stats
* The insight should have 3 sentences each with a mini insight prepended with a number (1), (2), (3)
* Each mini insight should be 15 words max
* Emphasize on any anomalies or unexpected findings in the insights

Example response:
<answer>This contains a direct answer to the given question</answer>
<header>A 7 word max header that summarizes the insight and it should be a meaningful statement</header>
<insight>This should explain an interesting discovery from the stats and the data_sample. Do not offer advice on what to do next</insight>
<indicator>Specify which indicator has been triggered or almost triggered by the findings and give a one line explanation</indicator>
<score>a score between 0 and 100 about how interesting and actionable this insight is</score>
<followup>this should contain a follow up question to explore the insight further and should be easily answerable from the dataset through basic data analytics</followup>
<severity>this should be a single word which is one of these (clear, low, medium, high)</severity>
